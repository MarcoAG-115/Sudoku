# Sudoku Machine
This cooperative project consist of a singular Go file that contains a program capable of solving a Sudoku puzzle. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice the basics of the Go programming language. 

## Running The Program
### Step 1:
Download main.go file and file1.txt. To run the program's tests, download all the files that are provided.
### Step 2:
Create a folder/directory in the "go" folder and place all the downloaded files in the
new folder.
### Step 3:
Access the newly created folder through the terminal. Run the code by entering the
following into the command line:
>go run main.go
### Solving a custom file
To solve a custom Sudoku board create a new plain text file or replace the contents of
file1.txt. The file's contents must follow these conditions:
- The number of characters must be exactly 81.
- Only the integers 0 through 9 are accepted.
- The contents must be placed in a 9x9 format with no spaces between the characters.

## Running the tests
At the end of the main function, uncomment the line that contains "testing()". Then
proceed by running the program normally. After solving the user's Sudoku file, the
program will run each test and display the results.

## Technologies
